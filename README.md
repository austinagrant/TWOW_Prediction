# TWOW_Prediction
#### The Winds of Winter is George R R Martin's most anticipated book with no hope in sight. I have been waiting with millions of others for him to release TWOW which would be the penultimate in his series A Song Of Ice and Fire. This project will be me attempting to predict the unpredictable :( as Martin's himself has attempted many times and failed to accuratly estiamte his time remaining. I expect that the model will not work at all. I will use a pre-trained LLM to do a sort of sentiment analysis, which will predict how much longer we have to wait for the book. I will be using Martin's 'Not a Blog' posts with the release date of previous books used to train the model for a TWOW prediction.
